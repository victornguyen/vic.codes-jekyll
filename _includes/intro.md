I'm a frontend developer living in Melbourne who really likes [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Destiny](https://www.destinythegame.com).

I'm currently contracting.

I've been on the Internet for a long time. I love what I do. I no longer have a beard.
