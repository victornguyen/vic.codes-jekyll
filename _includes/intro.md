I'm a Senior Front-end/UI Developer who really loves JavaScript.

I'm currently contracting. I used to work at [Igloo](http://www.igloo.com.au) in Melbourne, Australia as the “Front-end Development Manager”, where I did code and paperwork.

I’ve been on the Internet for a long time. I love what I do. Sadly, I no longer have a beard.
