I'm currently freelancing. I used to work at [Igloo](http://www.igloo.com.au) in Melbourne, Australia as the “Frontend Development Manager”, where I did code and paperwork.

I’ve been on the Internet for a long time. I love what I do. And I <s>really do</s> used to look like that drawing up there (I shaved).
